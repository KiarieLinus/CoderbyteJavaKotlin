// For this challenge you will be determining whether or not certain characters are in correct positions.
// The str parameter will be composed of + and = symbols 
// with several letters between them (ie. ++d+===+c++==a) 
// and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded 
// by a + symbol. So the string to the left would be false. 
// The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter.
